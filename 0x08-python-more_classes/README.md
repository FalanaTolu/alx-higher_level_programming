**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**



This project continued on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP). It highlighted the special `__init__`,  `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them. It also explained the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python, the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute, and between a class method and a static method


It showed how to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class, how to bind attributes to object and classes, what is contained in the `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class, how Python finds the attributes of an object or class and ow to use the `getattr` function.
