It showed how to use the *if, if ... else* statements and how to use the *while* and *for* loops. It also showed how to use comments, how to affect values to variables, how to use the break and continues statements, what the pass statement does, and when to use it, how to use range.


It explained functions and how to use them, the scope of variables, what a traceback is, what arithmetic operators are and how to use them.
